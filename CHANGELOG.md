# Changelog

## 1.1.0 (2026-04-01)

* Set `local = true` for the `geoip` search command so it runs on the search
  head instead of distributed peers. This avoids failures in distributed
  searches when indexers do not have the MaxMind databases or updater-managed
  app state available locally.

## 1.0.0 (2026-03-16)

* Initial release.
